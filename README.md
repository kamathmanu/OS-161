# OS161-1.11 

This was done in Fall 2017

- Implemented semaphores, locks (mutex) and condition variables to synchronize threads. Used these primitives for solving synchronization problems.

- Implemented read(), write(), wait(), exit(), time(), fork() and exec() system calls to enable user mode functions, and running of user mode processes.

- Rebuilt the virtual memory system to use on-demand paging for more efficient memory management.
